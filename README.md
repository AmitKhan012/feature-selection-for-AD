Gene expression data is an important factor in identifying the progression of Alzheimerâ€™s disease. However, training a machine learning model with this kind of high dimensional dataset is time-consuming 
and may lead to atrocious problems in machine learning known as overfitting. In this study, we aim to select features from gene expression data in ADNI to avoid overfitting and minimize computational costs.
Before applying the feature selection procedure, data preprocessing will be done. In the gene expression data modality, the same gene symbol is expressed by different probesets. After data analysis, appropriate
statics measures will be chosen to replace those multiple values for each gene symbol.
